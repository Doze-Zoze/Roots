Roots is a mod that seeks to re-imagine the Terraria experience by building on core concepts from older versions of Terraria that were lost in the modern game.

Roots does not add any new content of it's own, but greatly adjusts vanilla terraria content. It makes changes to 19 accessories, 17 weapons, 3 enemies, and one boss.
These changes fall under these sweeping changes:
- Removal of class-specific damage, and rebalancing of all gear to match
- Review and adjustments of all weapons to fit into a more tightly-planned weapon design philosophy
- Changes to the Mana system to be a more valuable resource
- Adjusting enemy and boss AI to be more unique, while still fitting into the vanilla game
