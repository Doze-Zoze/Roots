Roots is a mod that seeks to re-imagine the Terraria experience by building on core concepts from older versions of Terraria that were lost in the modern game into a new, modernized experience.

Roots does not add any new content of it's own, but greatly adjusts vanilla terraria content. It currently makes changes to 33 armor sets, 19 accessories, 17 weapons, 4 enemies, two bosses, and multiple core mechanics.
All changes are adjustable in configs.
These changes fall under these sweeping changes:
- Removal of class-specific damage, and rebalancing of all gear to match
- Review and adjustments of all weapons to fit into a more tightly-planned weapon design philosophy
- Changes to the Mana system to be a more valuable resource
- Adjusting enemy and boss AI to be more unique, interesting, and purposeful
- Removing natural life regeneration, but increasing the value of Healing Potions
